# Battleship-Game

Battleship is a real-time multiplayer battleship game. Players first choose the positions that they
would like their battleships to be on the grids. Once the second player has chosen ship positions, players have a few seconds to head up to the grids to fight. Once a player sinks all of the opponent's ships, the game is over!
• Personal Contribution: Wrote the code to build the grid logic which identifies if the torpedo hit was successful or not (if it was a hit - highlight grid with red color with an image of a sunken ship and an alert message or if it was a miss - highlight grid in white and an alert message). Overall design and styling of home page and game board including color, font-style, background-image, etc.
• Technologies: React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3. Component Library: Semantics UI, Material UI.
